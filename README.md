# DSP-CloudFinding

## What is this
This is a moc-webapplication created to forecast Noctilucent clouds.

## How to run
Currently the website has no auto updating features and the forecasts must be generated manually

### Run the website
The website itself is a simple flask-based application and can be run by downloading the files and 
running the command ```flask run``` on the command line

### Create a prediction
Predictions for dates can be generated by running the file forecast.py in the ml-code folder.
If you want to generate predictions for another date you must modify the varible ```start```
inside the main function to generate forecast for six hours after the given start time. By default
synthetic weather data will be generated instead of actual observations or weather forecast. Real
weather forecast can also be used by setting the default parameter ```synthetic=False``` when calling
the function ```get_grids()```.
